<p>Hello! My name is Alex Razo!</p>
<p>I am the biggest Taylor Swift fan; I love my pets and I love to eat tacos!</p>
    
<p>While I was living in Spain, I did my masters degree in Communications and Sports Journalism.</p> 
<p>I had the amazing opportunity to intern for one of the biggest sports clubs in the world, Real Madrid CF.</p> 
<p>I didnt get to personally meet the players, but I did have to chance to photograph them and attend training sessions and interviews.</p> 
    
<p>I enjoyed learning how to code because it has challenged me and expanded my creativity.</p> 
<p>I believe that if you have no limits, you can create anything!</p>
